Some notes.<br/>
1) Dispatch Section for Report is not yet done.
<br/>
2) The time on incoming reports is a few hours ahead. That explains why reports that are just submitted does not show up on the Google Maps.<br/>
3) On the main page of Reporting, Hiding the map cause some design problem.<br/>
4)On the Google maps, the number of reports that are shown should be reports that are approved and less than 6 months old. Currently, it shows all the indoor reports. I think.
