I figure that we probably might not touch this project anymore in the future so I'll just post a list of problems with the reporting module
.<br/>
1) Dispatch Section for Report is not yet done.
<br/>
2) The time on incoming reports is a few hours ahead. That explains why reports that are just submitted does not show up on the Google Maps.<br/>
3) On the main page of Reporting, Hiding the map cause some design problem.<br/>
4)On the Google maps, the number of reports that are shown should be reports that are approved and less than 6 months old. Currently, it shows all the indoor reports. I think.

Other random notes

1) List of security vulnerabilities in our email with subject - "Penetration Testing for Project Amity" - Shall not post the content here considering that anyone can see this page.
